# ðŸ“˜ Azure Network Architecture Transformation â€“ Hub-and-Spoke to Virtual WAN + ExpressRoute  

## 1. Executive Summary  
Our current Azure networking setup uses a **single hub-and-spoke model** with ~15â€“20 VNets per spoke, connected to on-premises through **site-to-site (S2S) VPN**. While this architecture has served us well, it introduces operational complexity, scaling limitations, and higher costs when expanded across multiple regions.  

The proposed target state is to adopt **Azure Virtual WAN (VWAN) with Secure Hub**, integrated with **ExpressRoute (ER)** as the primary on-premises connectivity and **VPN as failover**. This will streamline management, improve resiliency, and align with future multi-region disaster recovery needs, while keeping all workloads **within Europe**.  

This document presents the **baseline vs. target architecture**, a **TOGAF-aligned gap analysis**, the **business case for change**, and a **migration approach**.

## 2. Baseline Architecture (Current State)  

The **hub-and-spoke model** has been our standard approach. It consists of:  
- A **single central hub VNet** that hosts Palo Alto Firewall and Azure Firewall.  
- Around **15â€“20 spoke VNets**, each hosting different applications and workloads.  
- Connectivity to on-premises through **site-to-site VPN**.  

**Operational observations:**  
- VNet peering between hub and each spoke is **manual**, which creates administrative overhead.  
- Centralized inspection through firewalls adds complexity and latency.  
- Scaling becomes challenging as the number of VNets grows.  
- VPN gateways are bandwidth-limited and do not provide **SLA-backed guarantees**.

## 3. Target Architecture (Future State)  

The **target state** architecture simplifies and modernizes our network using **Azure Virtual WAN (VWAN)** with **Secure Hub**:  
- **VWAN Hub**: A Microsoft-managed hub that automates VNet connections.  
- **ExpressRoute (ER)**: Provides **private, SLA-backed connectivity** between on-premises and Azure (Europe region).  
- **S2S VPN**: Retained as **failover** for resiliency.  
- **Security**: Azure Firewall Premium inside VWAN Secure Hub for inspection, with Palo Alto still possible for advanced use cases.  

**Operational improvements:**  
- VNets connect directly to VWAN hub, removing the need for manual peering.  
- Centralized firewall management via Azure Firewall Manager.  
- Simplified onboarding of new VNets or branch locations.  
- Architecture is **future-ready** for multi-region DR in Europe.

## 7. Risks & Constraints  

| Risk / Constraint                          | Mitigation |
|--------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Migration Downtime**: Reconnecting VNets may cause brief outages. | Phased migration, test before cutover. |

## 8. Migration Approach  

A structured, phased migration will minimize disruption.  

**Step 1: Preparation**  
- Design VWAN hub architecture for Europe.  
- Provision ExpressRoute and connect to VWAN.  
- Set up backup VPN tunnels.  

**Step 2: Pilot**  
- Connect 2â€“3 VNets to VWAN.  
- Test connectivity, routing, and firewall rules.  

**Step 3: Gradual Migration**  
- Move remaining VNets in waves (5â€“6 at a time).  
- Run Palo Alto + VWAN Secure Hub in parallel.  
- Validate workloads before decommissioning old hub.  

**Step 4: Optimization**  
- Centralize firewall policies in VWAN Secure Hub.  
- Monitor cost and performance.  
- Fully retire hub-and-spoke once stable.

## 9. Cost & Operational Considerations  

### 9.1 Cost Comparison (Indicative â€“ insert estimates later)  

| Cost Category           | Current Hub-and-Spoke (Baseline) | Target VWAN + ER (Future) | Notes / Explanation |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| **Connectivity**        | VPN Gateway (~1.25 Gbps max), peering charges per VNet | ExpressRoute (10â€“20 Gbps scalable), VWAN Hub connection | ER provides predictable billing, higher throughput |
| **Firewalling**         | Palo Alto licenses + Azure Firewall (per hub) | Azure Firewall Premium in VWAN Hub (centralized), optional Palo Alto | VWAN may reduce Palo Alto footprint |
| **VNet Peering**        | Peering costs between each spoke and hub (~15â€“20 VNets) | Automated VWAN connections (included in VWAN costs) | Peering costs eliminated |
| **Operational Effort**  | High (manual peering, complex rules, troubleshooting) | Lower (centralized management in VWAN) | OPEX savings on admin & ops |
| **Scalability Costs**   | Expensive (each new VNet requires setup + peering) | Marginal (new VNet auto-attaches to VWAN hub) | Faster onboarding |
| **DR / Multi-region**   | Complex, duplicate hubs/firewalls in each region | Simplified, VWAN supports multi-hub in EU | Future-proof design |

### 9.2 TCO Projection (3-Year Horizon, Indicative)  

| Cost Type        | Year 1 (Setup + Run) | Year 2 (Run) | Year 3 (Run) | 3-Year Total | Notes / Explanation |
|------------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **CapEx**        | High (ER setup, VWAN provisioning, migration effort) | Low | Low | Moderate | Initial setup costs front-loaded |
| **OpEx â€“ Connectivity** | Medium (VPN + ER running in parallel) | Medium-Low (ER stabilized) | Medium-Low | Medium | VPN cost reduces after migration |
| **OpEx â€“ Firewalling** | High (Palo Alto + Azure Firewall both active) | Medium (gradual Palo Alto reduction) | Medium-Low (mostly VWAN Firewall Premium) | Medium | Cost reduction as Palo Alto footprint reduces |
| **OpEx â€“ VNet Peering** | Medium (legacy peering until migration complete) | Low (VWAN auto-handling) | Low | Low | Peering costs eliminated |
| **OpEx â€“ Operations/Admin** | Medium-High (dual ops during migration) | Medium (VWAN learning curve) | Low (optimized ops) | Medium-Low | Strong efficiency gains in long run |
| **Total (Indicative)** | High | Medium | Medium-Low | Lower than baseline | Long-term predictable OPEX model |

**Key Financial Insight:**  
- **Year 1**: Costs peak due to ER provisioning, VWAN setup, and dual-running firewalls.  
- **Year 2**: Costs normalize as Palo Alto and peering charges reduce.  
- **Year 3**: Lowest run rate â€“ only ER + VWAN Secure Hub remain, with reduced admin effort.  
- **Result**: Lower 3-year TCO vs. hub-and-spoke, despite Year 1 spike.  

### 9.3 Operational Benefits  
- Reduced troubleshooting effort (simpler topology).  
- Standardized firewall and routing rules.  
- Faster VNet onboarding (minutes instead of days).  
- Improved monitoring through Azure Monitor and VWAN Insights.
