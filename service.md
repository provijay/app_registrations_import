# Azure Services SLA & Multi-Region DR Assessment

## 1. Introduction
This document serves as a central reference point for understanding the availability, resiliency, and disaster recovery (DR) posture of all Azure services currently in use (or planned to be used) by our business units.

Modern enterprises rely heavily on cloud services to deliver mission-critical applications. However, each Azure service comes with its own Service Level Agreement (SLA) and resiliency capabilities. At the same time, our business units define their own SLA expectations, often in terms of availability, Recovery Point Objective (RPO), and Recovery Time Objective (RTO).

The purpose of this document is to:

✅ List all relevant Azure services and identify which ones are used by our business units.

✅ Capture business unit SLA requirements (availability, RPO, RTO) for each service.

✅ Compare business expectations with Microsoft’s published SLAs for these services.

✅ Identify gaps or risks where business requirements exceed Microsoft’s guarantees.

✅ Provide recommendations for multi-region deployment, failover strategies, or architecture adjustments to meet enterprise resiliency needs.

✅ Serve as a decision framework for aligning technology capabilities with business continuity requirements.

This document will evolve over time as:

New Azure services are onboarded.

Microsoft updates SLAs or introduces new resiliency options.

Business SLA requirements change due to compliance, risk appetite, or strategic shifts.

Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that our cloud service availability and disaster recovery strategy align with business expectations and compliance obligations.

## 6. Gap Analysis
| Service        | Business SLA | Microsoft SLA | Gap      | Risk    | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|----------|---------|-------|
| Azure SQL DB   | 99.99%       | 99.99%        | None     | Low     | Meets requirement |
| Azure VMs      | 99.99%       | 99.95%        | -0.04%   | Medium  | Needs AZ deployment |
| Azure Storage  | 99.95%       | 99.9%         | -0.05%   | Medium  | Enable GRS/RA-GRS |
| App Gateway    | 99.99%       | 99.95%        | -0.04%   | Medium  | Ensure ≥2 instances |

---

## 7. Opportunities for Multi-Region DR
- **Azure SQL Database**: Use **Auto-failover groups** with geo-replication  
- **Azure VMs**: Deploy **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)** to paired region  
- **Azure Storage**: Enable **GRS or RA-GRS** for resilience  
- **App Service**: Deploy across multiple regions with **Traffic Manager/Front Door**  
- **Key Vault**: Use **Geo-redundant vaults** for critical secrets

## 8. Decision Framework for Multi-Region DR
| Criteria                 | Question | Action |
|--------------------------|----------|--------|
| SLA Gap                  | Does business SLA > MS SLA? | If Yes → Multi-region needed |
| RPO/RTO Requirements     | Are RPO/RTO tighter than Azure guarantees? | If Yes → Design DR strategy |
| Business Criticality     | Is the service mission-critical (finance, customer-facing, compliance)? | If Yes → Multi-region recommended |
| Cost vs. Risk            | Is multi-region cost justified by risk reduction? | If Yes → Proceed; else accept risk |

## SLA Strategy by Azure Service

| Azure Service          | SLA Strategy Recommendation                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **App Service / API**   | Use **App Service Environment (ASE)** or **Availability Zones** for ≥99.95%. For active-active, use **Front Door**. |
| **App Gateway**         | Deploy in **zonal configuration**. For higher SLA → pair with **Azure Front Door** for global failover. |
| **Azure Front Door**    | Global active-active by default. Recommended for **mission-critical web workloads**.         |
| **Traffic Manager**     | DNS-based geo-routing. Suitable for **multi-region failover** (higher RTO vs Front Door).   |
| **Azure SQL**           | Zone redundant (ZRS) for ≥99.95%. Use **Auto-failover groups** for geo-redundancy.          |
| **Cosmos DB**           | Enable **multi-region writes** for 99.999% SLA.                                             |
| **Azure Storage**       | Use **ZRS** for intra-region, **RA-GRS** for cross-region DR.                               |
| **Key Vault**           | Use **Premium tier with zone redundancy**.                                                  |
| **AKS**                 | Deploy node pools across **Availability Zones**. Use **multi-region clusters** if SLA >99.95%. |
| **VMs**                 | Use **Availability Sets** or **Zones** for resilience. For higher SLA → use paired region failover. |
