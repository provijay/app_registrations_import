# Azure Services SLA & Multi-Region DR Assessment

## 1. Introduction
This document serves as a central reference point for understanding the availability, resiliency, and disaster recovery (DR) posture of all Azure services currently in use (or planned to be used) by our business units.

Modern enterprises rely heavily on cloud services to deliver mission-critical applications. However, each Azure service comes with its own Service Level Agreement (SLA) and resiliency capabilities. At the same time, our business units define their own SLA expectations, often in terms of availability, Recovery Point Objective (RPO), and Recovery Time Objective (RTO).

The purpose of this document is to:

✅ List all relevant Azure services and identify which ones are used by our business units.

✅ Capture business unit SLA requirements (availability, RPO, RTO) for each service.

✅ Compare business expectations with Microsoft’s published SLAs for these services.

✅ Identify gaps or risks where business requirements exceed Microsoft’s guarantees.

✅ Provide recommendations for multi-region deployment, failover strategies, or architecture adjustments to meet enterprise resiliency needs.

✅ Serve as a decision framework for aligning technology capabilities with business continuity requirements.

This document will evolve over time as:

New Azure services are onboarded.

Microsoft updates SLAs or introduces new resiliency options.

Business SLA requirements change due to compliance, risk appetite, or strategic shifts.

Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that our cloud service availability and disaster recovery strategy align with business expectations and compliance obligations.

## 8. Decision Framework for Multi-Region DR
| Criteria                 | Question | Action |
|--------------------------|----------|--------|
| SLA Gap                  | Does business SLA > MS SLA? | If Yes → Multi-region needed |
| RPO/RTO Requirements     | Are RPO/RTO tighter than Azure guarantees? | If Yes → Design DR strategy |
| Business Criticality     | Is the service mission-critical (finance, customer-facing, compliance)? | If Yes → Multi-region recommended |
| Cost vs. Risk            | Is multi-region cost justified by risk reduction? | If Yes → Proceed; else accept risk |

---
## 9. Findings & Recommendations

- **Key Gaps**:  
  After reviewing the business SLA requirements against Microsoft SLA guarantees, several **critical gaps** have been identified:  
  1. **Compute Services**: Single-instance Azure VMs, AKS clusters, or App Services without Availability Zones or multi-region deployments are vulnerable to regional outages. SLA gaps exist where business requires ≥99.99% availability but Microsoft SLA guarantees are lower without redundancy.  
  2. **Databases**: Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, and other managed databases may not meet business RPO/RTO if geo-replication or multi-region failover is not configured.  
  3. **Storage**: Core storage services such as Blob Storage, Data Lake, and NetApp Files require **RA-GRS or GRS** to meet cross-region durability. Single-region deployments risk data unavailability in disaster scenarios.  
  4. **Networking & Security**: Application Gateway, Front Door, Load Balancer, and VPN Gateway can introduce bottlenecks or SLA gaps if not deployed redundantly across zones or regions.  

- **High Risk Services**:  
  Services that are **critical to business continuity** and exhibit the largest SLA gaps are flagged as high risk. These include:  
  - **Azure VMs** hosting core applications without multi-zone or paired-region failover.  
  - **Azure SQL Database / Managed Instances** without Auto-failover groups or geo-replication.  
  - **Application Gateway / WAF / Front Door** without zonal deployment or global failover configuration.  
  - **Azure Storage** not using RA-GRS/GRS for critical datasets.  
  These services, if disrupted, could have **major business impact**, including downtime of key operations, financial loss, or customer dissatisfaction.  

- **Multi-Region DR Candidates**:  
  The following services are recommended for **multi-region deployment** to meet business continuity objectives:  
  - **Compute**: VMs, App Service, AKS, Azure Functions – deploy across **Availability Zones and paired regions**.  
  - **Databases**: Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, MySQL/PostgreSQL – enable **geo-replication / auto-failover groups**.  
  - **Storage**: Blob, File, Queue, Data Lake Storage, NetApp Files – enable **GRS/RA-GRS** for cross-region redundancy.  
  - **Networking**: Application Gateway, Front Door, Load Balancer – deploy **multi-region** with Traffic Manager or Front Door for failover.  
  Services with **high transaction volume, customer-facing impact, or regulatory importance** are the **primary candidates** for multi-region DR.  

- **Final Recommendations**:  
  1. **Close SLA Gaps**: Implement Azure features like **Availability Zones, paired regions, zone-redundant storage, and auto-failover groups** to meet business SLA targets.  
  2. **Prioritize High-Risk Services**: Start with services whose downtime would cause the greatest business impact. Ensure they have **tested DR strategies**.  
  3. **Multi-Region Deployments**: Adopt **active-active or active-passive deployments** for mission-critical services, using **Front Door, Traffic Manager, and geo-redundant storage**.  
  4. **Monitor & Validate**: Establish **continuous monitoring and regular failover testing** to verify RPO/RTO compliance.  
  5. **Document & Communicate**: Maintain comprehensive **SLA, DR, and operational procedures**; educate IT teams on recovery steps.

## 10. Decision Flow for SLA & Multi-Region Strategy

- **Key Gaps**:  
  Identify services where **current deployment falls short** of business SLA, RPO, or RTO targets. These gaps could be caused by:  
  - Single-region deployment  
  - Lack of Availability Zones or redundancy  
  - Insufficient replication for storage or databases  

- **High Risk Services**:  
  Determine services that are **critical to core operations or regulatory compliance**. Evaluate the **impact of downtime** in terms of:  
  - Revenue or operational disruption  
  - Customer or stakeholder impact  
  - Data loss or compliance violation  

- **Multi-Region DR Candidates**:  
  Evaluate **geo-redundancy options** for each critical service:  
  - Active-active vs active-passive architecture  
  - Cost-benefit analysis for multi-region deployment  
  - Use of **Azure-native DR features** (e.g., Auto-failover groups, RA-GRS, Front Door, Site Recovery)  
  - Prioritize services where DR adds the most resilience with minimal complexity  

- **Final Recommendations**:  
  Decision-making should follow a structured framework:  
  1. **Implement redundancy** for high-risk services using AZs, paired regions, and geo-redundant storage.  
  2. **Align business SLA with achievable Microsoft SLA**, and add complementary strategies where gaps exist.  
  3. **Deploy multi-region DR** for critical services with validated failover plans.  
  4. **Continuously monitor performance and SLAs**, updating DR strategy based on operational learnings.  
  5. **Document all DR processes** and communicate clearly with IT and business stakeholders for preparedness.
